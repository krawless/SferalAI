# Environment Variable Management Improvements

## Summary

This document summarizes the improvements made to prevent environment variable precedence issues and improve the developer experience.

## Problem Statement

The original issue was caused by environment variable precedence where shell environment variables would override `.env` file values, causing:
- PM2 processes connecting to wrong ports
- `.env` changes not taking effect
- Confusion when `pm2 restart --update-env` didn't work

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Environment Variable Checking Script ✅

**Added:** `check-env` script to `package.json`

**Purpose:** Detects conflicting shell environment variables before starting PM2

**Usage:**
```bash
bun run check-env
```

**Output:**
- ✅ Success: "No conflicting shell environment variables detected"
- ⚠️ Warning: Lists conflicting variables and provides `unset` command

### 2. Safe PM2 Startup Scripts ✅

**Added:** `pm2:dev:safe` and `pm2:prod:safe` scripts to `package.json`

**Purpose:** Automatically run environment check before starting PM2

**Usage:**
```bash
bun run pm2:dev:safe   # Development with environment check
bun run pm2:prod:safe  # Production with environment check
```

### 3. Explicit dotenv Loading in Ecosystem Configs ✅

**Updated:**
- `ecosystem.config.cjs`
- `ecosystem.production.config.cjs`

**Changes:**
- Added `require('dotenv').config({ override: true })` at the top
- Explicitly pass environment variables to PM2 processes
- Added comments explaining the purpose

**Benefits:**
- Forces `.env` values to override shell variables
- Makes environment variable flow explicit and traceable
- Prevents confusion about where values come from

### 4. Comprehensive Troubleshooting Documentation ✅

**Created:** `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

**Contents:**
- Detailed environment variable debugging guide
- Step-by-step solutions for common issues
- Explanation of environment variable precedence
- PM2 process management troubleshooting
- Database connection issues
- Port conflicts
- Installation problems

### 5. Enhanced Existing Documentation ✅

**Updated `README.md`:**
- Added "Environment Variable Precedence" section
- Explained the three-tier precedence system
- Added quick troubleshooting steps
- Listed new `check-env` and safe startup commands
- Added link to TROUBLESHOOTING.md

**Updated `PM2_GUIDE.md`:**
- Added prominent "Environment Variables Not Loading from .env" section
- Marked as "most common issue"
- Provided detailed debugging commands
- Added prevention tips
- Enhanced existing troubleshooting sections

**Updated `QUICKSTART.md`:**
- Added pre-flight check before "Start Development" section
- Updated "Available Commands" to include environment check
- Enhanced troubleshooting section with environment variable issues as first item
- Added link to TROUBLESHOOTING.md

### 6. Added dotenv Dependency ✅

**Updated:** Root `package.json`

**Added:** `"dotenv": "^17.2.3"` to dependencies

**Reason:** Ecosystem config files run in root context and need dotenv to be available

## Environment Variable Precedence (Documented)

The following precedence order is now clearly documented:

1. **Shell environment variables** (Highest Priority)
   - Set via `export VAR=value`
   - Defined in `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `.profile`
   
2. **PM2 ecosystem config `env` section** (Medium Priority)
   - Explicitly defined in `ecosystem.config.cjs`
   
3. **.env file** (Lowest Priority)
   - Loaded by dotenv
   - With `override: true`, can override shell variables (our solution)

## Best Practices Documented

1. ✅ Never set project-specific environment variables in shell config files
2. ✅ Always use `.env` file for configuration
3. ✅ Run `bun run check-env` before starting PM2
4. ✅ Use safe startup scripts (`pm2:dev:safe`, `pm2:prod:safe`)
5. ✅ When changing `.env`, do `pm2 delete all` not `pm2 restart`
6. ✅ Verify loaded variables with `pm2 env [process-id]`

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `package.json` - Added check-env and safe startup scripts, added dotenv dependency
2. ✅ `ecosystem.config.cjs` - Added dotenv loading with override, explicit env vars
3. ✅ `ecosystem.production.config.cjs` - Added dotenv loading with override, explicit env vars
4. ✅ `README.md` - Added environment variable precedence section
5. ✅ `PM2_GUIDE.md` - Enhanced troubleshooting section
6. ✅ `QUICKSTART.md` - Added pre-flight check and enhanced troubleshooting

## Files Created

1. ✅ `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide (600+ lines)
2. ✅ `ENV_VAR_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - This document

## User Benefits

### Prevention
- Automatic detection of conflicting environment variables
- Clear warnings before issues occur
- Safe startup scripts that check environment first

### Debugging
- Clear documentation of how environment variables work
- Step-by-step debugging commands
- Comprehensive troubleshooting guide

### Education
- Understanding of environment variable precedence
- Best practices for environment configuration
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

## Testing the Implementation

### Test 1: Check Environment Script
```bash
# Should pass if no conflicts
bun run check-env

# Create a conflict
export VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:9999

# Should now fail with warning
bun run check-env

# Clean up
unset VITE_API_URL
```

### Test 2: Safe Startup
```bash
# Set up a conflict
export PORT=9999

# Try safe startup (should fail with clear message)
bun run pm2:dev:safe

# Clean up and retry
unset PORT
bun run pm2:dev:safe  # Should succeed
```

### Test 3: Dotenv Override
```bash
# Set shell variable
export VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:9999

# Start PM2 (dotenv should override)
pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs

# Check what PM2 loaded
pm2 env 0 | grep VITE_API_URL
# Should show value from .env, not shell

# Clean up
pm2 delete all
unset VITE_API_URL
```

## Migration Guide for Existing Users

If you're updating an existing project:

1. **Update dependencies:**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. **Check for conflicts:**
   ```bash
   bun run check-env
   ```

3. **Clean your shell profile:**
   Remove any project-specific exports from `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.

4. **Restart PM2 cleanly:**
   ```bash
   pm2 delete all
   bun run pm2:dev:safe
   ```

5. **Verify configuration:**
   ```bash
   pm2 env 0 | grep -E 'VITE|PORT'
   ```

## Future Improvements (Optional)

Potential future enhancements:

1. Add `postinstall` script to remind users to run `check-env`
2. Create a `setup` script that combines all setup steps
3. Add environment variable validation (correct format, etc.)
4. Create a `pm2:status` script that shows environment variables
5. Add automated tests for the check-env script

## Conclusion

These improvements significantly enhance the developer experience by:
- Preventing common environment variable issues
- Providing clear error messages and solutions
- Educating users about environment configuration
- Making the template more production-ready

The implementation follows best practices and provides comprehensive documentation for both prevention and troubleshooting.
